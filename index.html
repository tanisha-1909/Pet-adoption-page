            <h3>Meet Tom</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Tom, the cat, is a curious and playful companion who fills every moment with excitement. With his soft gray fur and bright, mischievous eyes, he loves to explore every nook and cranny of the house. Whether he's chasing after a rolling ball or pouncing on a dangling string, his energy never seems to run out. Tom has a habit of curling up in the sunniest spot by the window, lazily stretching as he watches the world outside. He greets his humans with soft meows, especially when he wants a treat or some extra cuddles. Despite his playful nature, he can be quite the troublemaker, often knocking things off tables just for fun. At night, he sneaks onto the bed, curling up at the feet of his favorite person for warmth. He has a deep love for fish and will do anything to get a bite when it's on the menu. </p>

            <h3>Meet jerry</h3>
            <div >
                <p>Jerry, the dog, is a bundle of joy and energy, always ready for an adventure. With his fluffy golden fur and wagging tail, he runs around the house, bringing happiness wherever he goes. He loves playing fetch, chasing after his favorite ball with excitement and speed. Jerry is always the first to greet his family at the door, jumping up with pure enthusiasm. His favorite pastime is lying on his back, belly up, waiting for belly rubs and head pats. Despite his playful nature, he is a loyal protector, always keeping a watchful eye on his loved ones. He has a special love for treats and will perform all his tricks just for a tasty reward. Whenever it rains, he enjoys splashing in puddles, making a mess but having the time of his life. At night, he curls up beside his favorite person, snoring softly as he dreams of his next adventure. </p>
